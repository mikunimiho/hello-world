# hello-world

Hello!

I'm Miho Mikuni.
I like to talk with study abroad students because I am able to spread myself.
I have friends from Benin. I like Beninese. Beninese is very cute and mild.
I am the Campus support tutor. The activity is intoroducing Japan cultures and to support of a study abroad students life.
I kept in touch by SNS. But it was difficult to keep in touch when I would like to decide a schedule. Then I met their after class and to talk with them. I could decide our schedule.
